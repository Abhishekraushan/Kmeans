# Kmeans
A clustering algorithm that run with different centroid seeds


K-means is one of the simplest unsupervised learning algorithms that solve the well known clustering problem.

Process: 
      >> python kmeans.py

You can remove the main function and call kmeans function in other program but the centroid should be in list of tuples and data should be in list of list or you can change function according to your need.
